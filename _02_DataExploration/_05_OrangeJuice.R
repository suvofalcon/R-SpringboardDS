# Exploratory Data Analysis - Orange Juice data
# Analysis of the weekly sales data of refrigerated 64-ounce orange juice containers from 83 stores in the Chicago area.
# There are different brands, many stores and many time periods
# Recorded store sales in logarithms; logmove

# We may be interested in assessing whether the sensitivity (elasticity) of the sales to changes in the price
# depends on the income of the customers who live in the storeâ€™s neighborhood. We may expect that the price elasticity is largest in poorer 
# neighborhoods as poorer customers have to watch their spending budgets more closely. To follow up on this hypothesis, we look for the stores in 
# the wealthiest and the poorest neighborhoods.

# we will extract out store with highest average income and store with lowest average income

# we may continue this exploration for other stores as well

# We can use this data set to investigate clustering. We may want to learn whether it is possible to reduce the 83 stores to a smaller number of 
# homogeneous clusters.Furthermore, we may want to explain sales as a function of explanatory variables
# such as price, feature advertisements, and the characteristics of the store neighborhood. In particular, we may want to study whether 
# the effects of price changes and feature advertisements depend on demographic characteristics of the store neighborhood.
